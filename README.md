<h1 align="center">Can't Stop!</h1>
<h4 align="center">A collaborative academic project which is a video game version of the popular board game "Can't Stop!".</h4> <br>


This object-oriented game was developed using java collaboratively with a team as an academic project, hence, the source code is unsharable. The code is structured following polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction which played asignificant role in the success of the project. I worked collaboratively to make a cohesive and low coupling code and also designed AI players with levels of difficulties.<br><br><br>


In the following video we showcase the entire game running with features like playing with 1 to 4 players, using computer players with two levels of difficulty (notice how player 3 and 4 are less likely to bust and more likely to win because their algorithms make them pick the most profitable moves). We have a how to play section and a settings menu with options like changing window or text sizes and using color palletes to accomodate different color blindness. We can see the game announcing a player victor after they get three columns.<br>

<br><br>Now we see video demonstrating the save and load feature in our game which works by serializing classes and creates a ser file for each save. These get placed in the same directory as the driver.jar file. <br>
